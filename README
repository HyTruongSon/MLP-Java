Support
-------
* Stochastic learning process
* Batch learning process
* Sigmoid activation function
* Learning through Back-propagation
* Network architecture with number of layers:
  - 2 layers (0 hidden layer): Input - Output
  - 3 layers (1 hidden layers, most popular): Input - Hidden - Output
  - 4 layers (2 hidden layers): Input - Hidden 1 - Hidden 2 - Output
  - 5 layers (3 hidden layers): Input - 3 Hidden Layers - Output
  - 6 layers (4 hidden layers): Input - 4 Hidden Layers - Output

Efficiency
----------
* Fast convergence with momentum setup.
* On MNIST database, the testing error is approximately 3% (~97% correct).

Structure
---------
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP, Feed-Forward Artificial Neural Network) library class:
$ ~/MyLib/MLP.java

MNIST database folder:
$ ~/mnist-database

Compilation
-----------
Training MLP for MNIST database:
$ javac training_mnist.java
$ java training_mnist

Testing MLP for MNIST database:
$ javac testing_mnist.java
$ java testing_mnist

Note
----
* The MLP library is designed in an object oriented programming way. The API is very straight forward. The users can learn the API from two example codes.
